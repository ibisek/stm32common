STM32 libraries

This is a set of libraries I use for development based on Standard Development Library (SPL) mainly for STM32 F103, F030 and F303.

There are APIs for SPI, I2C, Serial 1+2, CAN bus, SDA card (FAT) driver, some sensors and DMA based experiments.

It took me some years to come to this state. I would really appreciate such a repo those years ago - not only to just to stupidly copy and use the code but also to learn some stuff.

From my personal experience I know the beginnings with STM32 could be hard and thus I hope this will aid you folks a little bit with your nasty shenanigans ;)
